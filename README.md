## Fork changelog
This is fork of [devnoname120](https://github.com/devnoname120)'s [vhbb](https://github.com/devnoname120/vhbb).

Changes:
- Removed Gekihen splash, improving app responsiveness 

## Prerequisites

Optional:

- [PSP2SHELL](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/PSP2SHELL#readme): automatically send and reload app after compilation, see [Running](#Running).
- debugnet: real-time logging that can be viewed from your computer, see [Logging](#Logging).

## Building

To build VHBB, you'll need to have the [vitasdk](https://vitasdk.org) installed and working.

Then run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. -DDEBUGNET=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

To run VHBB:

- send the generated `.vpk` to your vita:
	- start an FTP server on your vita, for example [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases).
	- upload the vpk to the vita using a FTP client.
- install the .vpk on your vita using a vpk installer, for example [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases).
- a new folder will be created under `ux0:/app/` named `/VHBBCLN01/`.

You can also use [PSP2SHELL](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/PSP2SHELL#readme) in order to send and reload the application easily after compilation:

- put the IP of your PS Vita in a new file `psvitaip.txt`
- every time you do modifications and want to test them, you can execute `make psp2shell` which will automatically compile, send, and reload the application.

## Logging

Debug code prints text in order to help the debugging. Currently debugnet and file logging are supported.

Instructions to use debugnet:

- install [debugnet](https://github.com/psxdev/debugnet#readme)
- set the local IP of your computer in `debugnetip.txt`
- compile VHBB using `cmake .. -DDEBUGNET=ON`
- on your computer, listen to the port 18194
  - with [netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/): `nc -u -l -p 18194`
  - with [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/): `socat udp-recv:18194 stdout`
- install VHBB on your PS Vita and start it. The logging should display in the terminal.


Instructions to enable file logging:
- close VHBB
- launch it by pressing the special text ([image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2824100/47955435-678b3700-df98-11e8-9ae5-cc7c3bc62e5a.png))

## Notes

- icon0.png, startup.png and bg.png must be using indexed palettes.
- PNG files created in some image editors will cause the .vpk intallation to crash.
	You may use PNGO to optimise addition PNG files (included under `/tools/`),
	or [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/).
